This model is A hybrid meta-populationnal model that couple ABM and EBM, the dynamics of the disease is managed by the       differential   equations solved by the rk4 method in each city. The bihavior of all andividuals is considered          separetly and managed by ABM. 

To run these source codes, download GAMAPLATFORM 1.8 url: https://gama-platform.github.io/download for free. Please be sure that you have JDK or JRE installed in your system. Create a new model and copy/paste the model to your GAMA, file: HybridTB.gaml. 

Run R files to have friendly plots.
